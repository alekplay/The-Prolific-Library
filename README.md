By tapping on a book, you can either:

* Check it out, which means adding your name and current timestamp as the latest "checkout"
* Edit it, changing anything from title, to author, publisher, and tags
* Share it on Facebook and Twitter, including an automatically genereted link to Google's "I'm feeling lucky" search

By tapping on add, you can:

* Create a new book

By tapping on clear, you can:

* Delete all books from the server

By swiping right on a book, you can:

* Delete this book only
